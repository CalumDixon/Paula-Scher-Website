<!-- In depth Section explaining who Paula Scher is-->
    
<section class="life-so-far" id="life-so-far">
    
    <h2>Life So Far</h2>
    
        <p>On the 6th of October 1948, Paula Scher was born in Virginia, USA. She moved frequently to Philadelphia and Washington DC before settling in Silver Spring, Maryland. Scher’s father was an engineer for the United States Geological Survey; he had invented a device for distortion-free aerial photos, This was an important factor that led to Scher painting her own maps.</p>
    
        <p>While growing up in Silver Spring Scher had an unhappy childhood because of this Scher began to use art and design to express herself as an escape from the troubles in her childhood. In high school, Scher took part in weekend art classes at the <i>Corcoran Art and Design College</i> but decided to keep these classes a secret from others because she thought it “Wasn’t the cool thing to do.” This later wasn’t the case when Scher became the school publicity chairman; making her responsible for the designing of all the schools' artwork such as posters for school events.
</p>
    
        <p>In the Late 1960’s Scher started studying in the <i>Tyler School of Art in Pennsylvania</i> where she studied a bachelor in fine arts. While studying Scher enrolled in an illustration class where she met her biggest inspiration <i>Stanislaw Zagorski</i> who in her words “ She owes everything to.” Scher stated that Zagorski knew that she was a designer even though at the time she was much more interested in illustration; Zagorski solution to this was to tell Scher that she should illustrate with type.</p>
    
        <p>After graduating from Tyler School of Art in 1970, Scher was hired to work in the advertising and promotional department of <i>CBS records.</i> Although Scher wanted design covers for music and not promotional material so she went to work for <i>Atlantic Records</i> which she worked with for 1 year before returning to CBS records as their East Coast Art Director. After working for CBS records for ten years in 1982 Scher decided to create her own business alongside a past friend from school named <i>“Terry Koppel.”</i> Koppel & Scher continued to work together for seven years in 1990 when a recession caused a lack of work coming in, Koppel decided to leave for a studio position in Esquire while Scher continued to run the business up until 1991. In 1991 Scher decided to disband her company when <i>“Woody Pirtle”</i> a partner at pentagram approached Scher and asked her to join the Pentagram collaborative.

    </section>
    
        <h3>Public Theater</h3>
    
            <p>The Public Theater approached Scher in 1994 to create their brand identity. At the time the Public Theater had a brand identity issue where they were known between multiple different names, it was the <i>“The Public Theater”, “The Joseph Papp Public Theater”</i> and some people only knew of the Public Theater from Shakespeare in Central Park. Scher was tasked with fixing the identity and of making all aspects of the Public theater feel like it was of one. 
</p>
    
            <p>Scher’s inspiration for the Public Theater’s logo was found in <i>“Rob Roy Kelly’s”</i> book <i>“American Wood Type 1823 – 1900: Notes on the evolution of decorated and large types”</i>. Scher said in Netflix’s documentary series <i> Abstract: The Art of Design</i> that she likes American wood type because it is powerful and has many forms. In the documentary Sher points to one particular page of Kelly’s book as her inspiration which showed a range of forms for the letter R; The showcased the letter R in various typefaces ranging from their skinniest forms to their widest forms. Scher realised that she could apply this to the word public to represent all of new york in Scher’s words <i>“Every type of weight was included.”</i></p>
    
            <p>Over time Scher has adjusted the identity of the Public Theater’s identity twice after its original creation. The original logo was created in 1994 using the typeface <i>“Morgan”</i> and had the word “Public” in black written vertically in varying type widths, it would end with the word “Theater” written horizontally capping the end of the logo. In 2005 the logo was recreated using the typeface <i>Akzidenz Grotesk</i> and the word “Theater” was removed from the logo. Most recently in 2008, the logo was adjusted again; the typeface was changed again this time to <i>Knockout</i>, The logo was now written horizontally and the logo was now capped at the end with a full stop. </p>

        <h3>Atlantic Theater Company</h3>
    
            <p>In 2015 Paula Scher was tasked with creating the brand identity for one of the most influential theater companies in new york; <i>“The Atlantic Theater Company.”</i> The theater is well known for producing plays that have a broad approach to theater and Scher wanted to reflect this with their brand identity.</p>
    
            <p>The brief given to Scher gave her two problems that needed to be solved, At the time the theater had to make the decision to promote themselves as an institution or their upcoming productions but by making this decision they would ultimately leave one or the other, unseen and potentially hurt their sales. The second problem that the theater faced was that in most cases no images would exist that could be used to promote their productions as they were as they were yet to be staged or photographed. </p>
    
            <p>The logo Scher created was an abstract A shape that could easily be recognisable as the letter A but also be perceived as a multitude of other things such as a spotlight or megaphone. The logo also had a wordmark version where all A’s were replaced using the Emblem logo Scher had created and all other letters used the compact sans serif typeface <i>Tungsten.</i> Scher solved the issue of being unable to decide between promoting the institution or the upcoming productions by creating a logo that was able to be incorporated into the design of the production advertisements, we can see this in the 2015–2016 season poster that promoted multiple productions and used the A shape emblem in a similar way to <i>Alexander Rodchenko's <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/alexander-rodchenko-books-please-in-all-branches-of-knowledge">“books (please) in all branches of knowledge”</a></i> as Scher uses the A shape in a similar way to make the design seem like it is yelling which resonates with the loud and proud attitude of New York while also being unique. The logo also solves the problem of the lack of imagery at hand for use in advertisements by providing an alternative to imagery in the form of a shape that can be used to create abstract illustrations or to be used as a stage for illustrative drawings.</p>

        <h3>NJPAC</h3>
    
            <p>Paula Scher was approached by <i>Larry Goldman</i> in 2000 representing the <i>"New Jersey Performing Arts Center"<b> (NJPAC)</i></b> to do environmental graphics for their building. Goldman showed Scher a building that he wanted her to work on it was an old rectory building built sometime in the 1940’s. The building according to Scher looked <i>“sadly institutional”</i> claiming that the brown and beige colour scheme throughout the building was depressing and off-putting. Goldman explained that NJPAC had received funding to adapt the building into a high school for the performing arts. Goldman informed Scher that the budget for the renovation was extremely limited meaning that they could not renovate the school using any fancy techniques; Goldman came to Scher to ask her if she would be able to reinvent the exterior of the building to show that it was an inspiring place that would be inviting for those wanting to study the performing arts.</p>
    
            <p>Scher decided the best action to take because of the limited budget would be to repaint the building in a unique way to make the building more appealing. Scher took photos of the building and used these to experiment by painting her ideas on top of the photos, she came up with many different variations ranging from; the building being covered head to toe in triangular flags to painting the building white and placing red and black stars across the walls. </p>
    
            <p>The variation that Goldman chose was the idea of painting the building white and covering the building in white and yellow typography with black outlines, this typography showcased the different activities offered by the NJPAC by using related keywords to the NJPAC such as <i>"dance, poetry and drama."</i>Goldman would then go on to ask Scher to help recreate the interior of the building. Scher approached creating the interior by creating patterns of chevrons, stripes and checkerboards to cover the floors of the building, a system of designs using the same patterns were created to cover radiators and fireplaces throughout the building. Scher then chose rehearsal room curtains in complementary colours for the designs in the rooms and had the NJPAC staffers go to Ikea and purchase furniture in the same colour palette. </p>

        <h3>Friends of the High Line</h3>
    
            <p>In 2000 <i>"Robert Hammond"</i> approached Pentagram looking for a retail identity for a company called Watch World which he was the marketing director for, Scher was interested in the job because she believed it would pay well and sent Hammond a proposal. Scher later heard back from Hammond when he asked her if he could speak to her about something private; Hammond had asked Scher if she would like to create a Brand Identity for an organisation named <i>Friends of the Highline</i> that's goal was the stop the city from deconstructing the 1.45 mile long abandoned Highline railway system in new york and turn it into the only elevated park within New York. Scher initially had no interest in creating the brand but thought she would not get the Watch World job if she were to say no.</p>
    
            <p>The logo Scher created was a simple letter H with two horizontal bars and the ascenders and descenders extended to make the letter form resemble a railroad. In 2001 Scher worked with Hammond and and his partner <i>"Joshua David"</i> to create a book named <i>“Design for the public trust”</i> which explained what the Highline was, discussed its history why it was important and most importantly why it was viable and beneficial to save it. Overtime as Hammond and David attempted to gather support they were able to obtain signatures from some wealthy members of society such as <i>"Martha Stewart."</i> and  A New York mayor candidate named <i>"Michael Bloomberg"</i> had also signed to save the Highline. Later Bloomberg won the election for mayor of new york meaning the project to save the Highline became much more credible and had real potential to happen.</p>
    
            <p>With this newfound credibility Friends of the Highline had obtained seed money from the city of New York which they were able to put to use campaigning to raise money to recreate the Highline into a tourist attraction. Over the course of the campaigning for 2–3 years Friends of the Highline were able to raise enough money to fund their project. Today the Highline has been converted into a public park as planned and has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in New York.</p>

        <h3>NYC Beaches</h3>
    
            <p>After <i>"Hurricane Sandy"</i> hit new york in 2012 it destroyed much of the boardwalk structures across the 14 miles of beach that took the brunt of the storm as well as displacing millions of tons of sand.</p>
    
            <p>As part of the restoration project, Scher had been hired to create what she called a <i>“Emotional Sign System.”</i> What Scher created were large blue and yellow signs that would change for each street by using photographs of the beach from the exact spot that the sign was to be placed. The intent of these signs was to help orient people when they arrived at the beach as there was often sand dunes blocking the view of the beach ahead and these signs would show the view from the other side.</p>
    
            <p>The signage also connected emotionally with the community in the area by showing that despite the damage that Sandy caused it was unable to take away the beauty of the beaches. It allowed the community to take pride in their portion of the beach as each photograph highlighted the unique beauty of each entrance to the beach as the view that the beach provided looked unique depending on which street you decided to enter it from.  There was so much pride taken from the signage system that Scher had created that the New York City Government created a Series of postcards based on the signage so that members of each town community could have their own miniature version of the sign that represented their portion of the beach.</p>

        <h3>Maps</h3>
    
            <p>In the late 1990’s Paula Scher started to create bright, vibrant typographic maps ranging from world maps to maps of its streets and neighbourhoods. Scher states that the reason she started to create her typography based maps was because in the late 1990’s everything she did became computerised she didn't use her hands to make anything in the past she cut, ripped and pasted, the loss of the physical involvement in the creation of her work was a huge loss for her and this prompted her to start painting.</p>
    
            <p>Scher was inspired to create maps by her father who was a mapmaker that created a device to reduce distortion in maps. Hearing words like distortion when referring to map making taught Scher that maps lied, this inspired Scher to take a more inspired approach to mapmaking by using it represent information; Scher refers to this approach as <i>“Abstract expressionist information.”</i> Many of Scher’s paintings she considers opinionated and based on how she feels about the world rather than to provide factual information.</p>
    
                <blockquote>“I began painting maps to invent my own complicated narrative about the way I see and feel about the world. I wanted to list what I know about the world from memory, from impressions, from media, and from general information overload. These are paintings of distortions.” – Paula Scher”</blockquote>
    
            <p>Examples of Scher’s maps include a world map of flight paths across the world, a map of the United States listing all of the postal codes within each of the counties,a United States map of the US time zones and area codes,a New York transit map and a map covering the topic of tsunamis off the coast of Sri Lanka. Scher finally collected all the 39 maps she had created at the time and published them in a book named <i>“Paula Scher: MAPS”</i> the book contained all her paintings, drawings, prints and environmental graphics related to her map paintings; the works inside her book are reproduced into real life scale folding out to be the same size of the originals, some even growing as tall as 12 feet in height. </p>

<!-- What I think of Scher's work -->
    
<section class="my-opinion" id="my-opinion">
    
    <h2>My Opinion On Scher’s Work</h2>
    
        <p>When I chose Paula Scher as the subject for my essay I was already familiar with her some of her work such as her map paintings and work for the Public Theater. Originally I had thought that she was an amazing typographer and that she was capable of creating designs that were amazing visually. </p>
    
        <p>After researching Scher’s work further though I found the additional meaning and history behind the approach of each design and more importantly to me how it solved the problems that each design faced, for example, I would have never imagined the user centred approach Scher had taken when creating the designs for the NYC beaches. It made me appreciate Scher’s work on an entirely new level, I got to see the consideration for people put behind each design. When researching I found a quote that highlights this human approach to design from Scher herself. <i>“There’s an emotional aspect to it, Design needs to take human behaviour into account.”</i></p>
